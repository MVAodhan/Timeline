        <div class = "chapterContent">
        <p>This book is in three parts. The first two, Miss Keller's story and the
            extracts from her letters, form a complete account of her life as far as
            she can give it. &nbsp;Much of her education she cannot explain herself, &nbsp;and
            since a knowledge of that is necessary to an understanding of what she
            has written, it was thought best to supplement her autobiography with
            the reports and letters of her teacher, &nbsp;Miss Anne Mansfield Sullivan.
            &nbsp;The addition of a further account of Miss Keller's personality and
            achievements may be unnecessary; &nbsp;yet it will help to make clear some of
            the traits of her character and the nature of the work which she and her
            teacher have done.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the third part of the book the Editor is responsible, though all
            that is valid in it he owes to authentic records and to the advice of
            Miss Sullivan.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Editor desires to express his gratitude and the gratitude of Miss
            Keller and Miss Sullivan to The Ladies' Home Journal and to its editors,
            Mr. Edward Bok and Mr. William &nbsp;V. &nbsp;Alexander, &nbsp;who have been unfailingly
            kind and have given for use in this book all the photographs which were
            taken expressly for the Journal; and the Editor thanks Miss Keller's
            many friends who have lent him her letters to them and given him
            valuable information; &nbsp;especially Mrs. Laurence Hutton, who supplied
            him with her large collection of notes and anecdotes; &nbsp;Mr. John Hitz,
            Superintendent of the Volta Bureau for the Increase and Diffusion of
            Knowledge relating to the Deaf;&nbsp; and Mrs. Sophia C. Hopkins, to whom Miss
            Sullivan wrote those illuminating letters, the extracts from which give
            a better idea of her methods with her pupil than anything heretofore
            published.
        </p>
        <p></p>
            Messrs. Houghton,&nbsp; Mifflin and Company have courteously permitted the
            reprinting of Miss Keller's letter to Dr. Holmes, &nbsp;which appeared in
            "Over the Teacups," and one of&nbsp; Whittier's letters to Miss Keller. &nbsp;Mr.
            S. T. Pickard,&nbsp; Whittier's literary executor,&nbsp; kindly sent the original of
            another letter from Miss Keller to Whittier.
